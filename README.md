# Blender Roblox Animations
### This is basically a very simple fix to a huge problem people have been facing in Blender.
---
This updated script basically changes the deprecated `bpy.ops.import_scene.obj()` to the newer `bpy.ops.wm.obj_import()`.

Hopefully this helps fix what people have with Blender.
I cannot fix any problems as I'm still learning Python.
